## AI Tinkerers Prague September 2024
https://prague.aitinkerers.org/talks/rsvp_ushlLXZWFM4

### Abstract

This talk is about building an AI-powered blog that uses trend data from Google and Amazon to write human sounding articles about what is trending.

### Agenda
1. Motivation for a trend app
2. Designing an AI-blog stack architecture
3. Implementation Details and Code Examples
4. How to take it further


## Justification
Given that a large part of the audience consists of AI researchers and developers, some of which are perhaps still looking for ways to apply their skills in the industry, the talk could serve as an inspiration on how to build a full stack AI project on AWS with Python as backend, Bubble.io as frontend and ChatGPT for content generation
